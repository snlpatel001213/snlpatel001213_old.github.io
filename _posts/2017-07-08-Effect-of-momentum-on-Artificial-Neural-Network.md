Before proceeding with this tutorial, prefer to go through [my previous tutorial](https://www.machinelearningpython.org/single-post/Neural-Network-Implementation) about Artificial Neural Network.

Code Compatibility : Python 2.7 , tested on ubuntu 16.04

As we saw in previous post, Network took pretty long time (~700 epochs) to converge. This is because it was very raw network without any optimization. In present tutorial we will use momentum while making update to weights. Momentum is known to converge network faster.

Momentum($\beta$) term can be represented as : 

$$  \Delta W(p) = \beta \cdot \Delta W_{jk}(p-1) + \alpha \cdot y_{j}(p) \cdot \delta_{y}(p)  $$


where $\beta$ is a positive number (1.01 - 1.02) called the momentum constant.  Typically, the momentum constant is set to 1.01
Above said equation is called the **generalized** delta rule.

To introduce new momentum term we will change our base code. **In present implementation we are $\beta$ = 1.01**

Upon plotting squared error obtained with  simple XOR gate  and XOR gate with momentum term, we will get below given graph.
