This is not just an ordinary blog a where I will show you some equation and sign off. This is an end to end blog series about Sequence to Sequence, We will start off with general Sequence to Sequence architecture, then one by one we will implement [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), [beam search](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-to-sequence.html), batch processing, [Pointer networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03134). A series of the blog where algorithm, equations, and Implementation will be parallelly covered. 
Sequence to Sequence is one size fit all kind of algorithm which is used in all below given tasks: 

- Machine Translation
- Summarization
- Question Answering
- chit chatbot
- Text Simplification
- image to code
- Speech to text
- text to speech
